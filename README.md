## Making Travel Fly Responsive
In this assignment, the main goal was to make the home page of the Travel Fly project responsive to different screen sizes. The size I based my media queries on was 800px. I used media queries to make the home images and form content stack vertically to fit onto a smaller screen size. I also made sure the margins on the sides of the content stayed consistent as not to disrupt the look of the site.
